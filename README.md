# Production-Planning-and-Bidding-Strategy-of-Microgrids-Using-Game-Theory
Abstract

A microgrid (MG) is part of a power generation system, which independently serves a local area. In recent years, using MGs has become more popular in the electricity industry, for it optimizes the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Nonetheless, discovering MGs' optimal generation scheduling and distribution strategy to capture the competitive market is still under investigation. This study intends to offer MGs a production planning model and a bidding strategy to participate in the next-day market. First, using optimization methods and predicted meteorological data, the authors propose an efficient production planning in which MGs' total thermal commitment and production costs are minimized, and the renewable thermal dispatch is optimized. In this step, MGs participate in the day-ahead competitive market to exchange their realized surplus or needed power. Secondly, using a non-cooperative Stackelberg game between multiple energy providers (MGs with abundance) and energy consumers (MGs in need), the authors match supply with demand at the optimal price. In the end, a numerical experiment was conducted, which indicates that applying the proposed model is more profitable for both MGs with surplus and MGs in need of power.
